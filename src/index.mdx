# Getting Started

In this documentation, we need to put the primary components, to the developer's team and new developers not create repeated components, and understood how the existing components work.

There are primary components per page too, in case this component is interesting to use on another page, we can put together the general components.

When creating a new component not forget to write the documentation.
